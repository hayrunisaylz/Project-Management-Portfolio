# Project-Management-Portfolio
This repository contains my application projects on project management and Agile/Scrum topics.
I was introduced to project management during my university education in a course where I took on a managerial role by leading a team.
This experience sparked my interest in managing entire processes and using project management tools.
After graduating, I pursued certifications in this field and am sharing the practical applications of the knowledge I gained through these projects.
They were prepared to reinforce my PM skills and provide concrete evidence for entry-level PM roles.
